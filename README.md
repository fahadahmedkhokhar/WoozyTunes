# WoozyTunes - Listen to Local Nightlife

This project is intended as a submission for Project 6 of Purdue's Fall 2015 CS252 Class.

## Todo:

* Finalize the Interface
* Integrate the UI with the Javascript
* Clean up the repository
* Make the playlists more "realistic"
* POTENTIALLY - Follow along with what's currently playing
* MAYBE Allow users to add new pins with playlists
* MAYBE Allow users to favorite playlists - implies a login function
* MAYBE Transfer more of our index.html code to a designated .js file. 
* MAYBE See if we can use the app.js for more than just authentication.

### Spotify Developer Info
