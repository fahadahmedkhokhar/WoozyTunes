# WoozyTunes - Listen to Local Nightlife

This project is intended as a submission for Project 6 of Purdue's Fall 2015 CS252 Class.

## Todo:

* Finalize the Interface
* Design and connect to a database instance 
* Once connected to database store playlist identifiers
* Potentially also store location coordinates on the DB to place on the map
* It would be cool too if we had a way for users to add playlists and coordinates
* Transfer more of our index.html code to a designated .js file. 
* See if we can use the app.js for more than just authentication.

### Spotify Developer Info

We registered these Redirect URIs. The localhost is for running on your own machine and the bluemix is for when we are running it on our instance.

* http://localhost:8888/callback
* http://woozytunes.mybluemix.net/callback
